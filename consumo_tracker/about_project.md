# About the Project

## Introduction

This is a extension project for my bacharelor graduation course at Unopar, but I think this idea kinda interesting and I've decided to put it in my GitHub as a little project to show my habilities.

## What is this project?

So, I have to do something for my city, can be in a community, church and/or more. This is for make the university closer of society, this is why students make "extension projects". Backing to project, it is done as a CLI initially  using ´´´python´´´, ´´´SQLite´´´ and '''JSON'''. I've decided to use them, cause are simple and easy to use for little projects, if someday I decide to grow it for a ´´´MySQL´´´ or make an interface it already go into path for an upgrade.
